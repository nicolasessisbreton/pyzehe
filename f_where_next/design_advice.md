# mantra
base code on test
code until it breaks
when it breaks, refactor

# sign that you need refactoring
- you need to type a parameter twice
- you need to copy paste the same line of code twice
- your code cannot be read
- your code contains comments

# refactoring to do daily
- put parameter value in a config file
- create many functions, each function should do one thing
- use tabs to make your code readable
- make your code runnable with test: 
	show how to use your code, rather than explaining it
